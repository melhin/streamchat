# StreamChat 

Is an attempt to make a completely self reliant redis stream chat using #fastapi
This project is heavily influenced by the [redis-streams-fastapi-chat](https://github.com/leonh/redis-streams-fastapi-chat)

My attempts would be to

* Refactor the single file and add a structure to it
* Add a basic authentication mechanism
* Make the new message feature available for the chat
